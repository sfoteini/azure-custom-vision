# Dataset: 17 Category Flower Dataset

To build and train our machine learning model, we will use the 17 Category Flower Dataset from the [Visual Geometry Group](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) (University of Oxford). 

We will use 3 out of 17 flower categories: Iris, Tigerlily and Tulip. You can download the 3 Category Flower Dataset from this GitHub repository. You can [download the full dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/index.html) from the Visual Geometry Groupâ€™s website.
